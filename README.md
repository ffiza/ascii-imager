# ASCII Imager

A simple program to convert and image into an ASCII-art version of it. To use,
put the image in the `images/` folder and run

```python ./code/main.py --image images/your_image.jpg --resize_factor 8```

This code will resize the original image by a factor of `8`, will generate
the ASCII-art version and output the new file as `output.png`.
